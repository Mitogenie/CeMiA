    "#### The image titled \"Global Mitochondrial Mask\" serves an important purpose, and can be extremely useful if used and interpreted properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This figure represents the global mitochondrial content mask for the image, and is not intended to reflect the final and detailed mitochondrial mapping or network in your cells (That's Mito Miner's job). The yellow objects on the image reflect all the objects on the image that are assessed as the probable mitochondrial content in the image, and would be assigned to different nuclei. This may also include some background noise, which is okay, since Mito Miner will take care of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lowering the \"Mitochondrial Signal Threshold\" would result in increase in the number and the area of the yellow objects in the image. This means that you have more mitochondrial candidate objects, which may increase the chance of capturing of true mitochondria in each image.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is true as long as the yellow objects across the image do not overlap and/or you are not capturing too much noise as mitochondria (i.e. parts of the image that you are sure that are noise and not real mitochondria)\n",
    "\n",
    "* More yellow content in the image means more assignment tasks, which in turn may increase the processing time.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Important: check a few images (using the drop down menu above) before you decide on your final threshold value, and make sure the set of parameters reasonably represents the mitochondrial content in all of those images, since the same threshold will be applied to the batch of images you are analyzing together.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There is an exception which is discussed in the \"My Cells Are Entangled\" part.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use \"Low Mitochondrial Signal\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* The most obvious situation is when you have low signal or low contrast images. Low signal levels, and low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), make it harder for Cell Catcher to detect mitochondria in the image and subsequently assign them to different cells. By selecting this option Cell Catcher will perform additional pre-processing on the images in attempt to capture more mitochondria.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you select this option in high signal/SNR images, it will result in forming of yellow clusters in the  \"Global Mitochondrial Mask\" figure, which is totally fine if the following two conditions are met:\n",
    "    * As a result of selecting this option you are not capturing excessive amounts of noise as mitochondrial candidates in the image (Similar to lowering the \"Mitochondrial Signal Threshold\").\n",
    "    * The yellow blobs formed around cells, or in general the yellow objects across the image are not overlapping or excessively touching each other.\n",
    "    * In both cases this option may increase the processing time since Cell Catcher should assign more content to various cells*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*There is an exception which is discussed in the \"My Cells Are Entangled\" part.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use \"My Cells Are Entangled\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If your cells have mitochondrial networks that are entangled, and it is very hard to decide on the boundaries of the adjacent cells, you may use this option. However, this option may increase the processing time up to 10X.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When you have cells with entangled mitochondrial networks, if you select \"Low Mitochondrial Signal\" and/or you drastically lower the \"Mitochondrial Signal Threshold” value, your actions may result in overlap or excessive touching of the mitochondrial networks from adjacent cells that may make the processing and separation of cells harder.\n",
